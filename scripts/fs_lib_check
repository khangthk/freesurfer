 NAME

	fs_lib_check

 SYNOPSIS

	fs_lib_check [-l] [-r] [-h] [-v]

 DESCRIPTION

	'fs_lib_check' merely checks if the operating system
	has the necessary system libraries required to run
	FreeSurfer.

	On rpm-based systems, this script queries the rpm databse
	for each of the FreeSurfer required libraries.

	On non-rpm systems, this script uses 'ldconfig' to check
	the dynamic library load map for instances of the required
	libraries.

 ARGUMENTS

 	-l
	Force use of 'ldconfig' to check for instances of required
	system libraries. This is useful on rpm systems if system
	libraries were installed from source code, and are thus not
	known to the sytem rpm database.

	-r
	Force use of 'rpm -qa' to check for installed library packages.
	If -r and -l are both specified concurrently, then behaviour
	is unspecified.

	-h
	Show this synopsis and exit.

	-v
	Show a version number and exit.


 PRECONDITIONS

	o This script assumes that you are on a Linux system.
	o It will not currently work on Apple OS X.
	o It should work on rpm and non-rpm systems.

 POSTCONDITIONS

	o Each test is echoed to the console as it runs.
	o A zero (0) is returned if all checks passed ok.
	o If a test fails, the script will exit with an error message.
	  You will need to install the required library to run FreeSurfer.

 HISTORY

 18 August 2005
 o Initial design and coding.
