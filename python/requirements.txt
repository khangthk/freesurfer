# Use this file to list version specifications for modules that may/may not be fixed.
# Nightly builds and releases will query what module revisions were installed
# into fspython (including use of this file) and subseuqently re-generate the
# requirmeents-build* files to list the current explicit revisions (and update
# the requirements-build* files in git). So requirments-build* files should not
# be manually edited and should be self-updating snapshots of foo==revision specs.
