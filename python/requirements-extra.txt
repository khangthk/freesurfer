SimpleITK
# Code from Eugenio uses SimpleITK above and also fireants below.
# But need to use Jackon's custom changes to the setup and
# install so that fireants iinstall does not revert the install
# of torch, pandas, nibabel to older versions, and does not
# change typing package.
#
# this one for the most recent commit in the 8.0.0 gamma pre-release build
